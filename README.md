2nd attempt for Landing Page exercise

Key changes I'd like to make on this attempt:

\* Make website more responsive, because the "Call to action! It's time" section (from first attempt) didn't shrink properly (or esthetically pleasing) below a width of 900px

\* Minimize time spent building. Didn't time it, but first attempt took roughly 5 hours. First attempt required add'l time to acquire some images. Will try to keep track of all time spent strictly on building/coding the 2nd time through

\* Result in cleaner code, because first attempt had 77 lines of code in index.html and 221 for style.css

1st attempt live page: https://cachemempool.github.io/Landing_Page/

2nd attempt took roughly 3 hours to complete.
